                        <p>
                            During my freshman year of high school, I participated in a two-week summer camp at UMass where I embarked on an exciting project. I ingeniously developed a Pong game that ingeniously utilized ultrasonic sensors to maneuver a cardboard paddle. These sensors cleverly gauged distances, translating them into gameplay movements. To bring this concept to life, I employed both Processing and Arduino for coding, effectively bridging hardware and software. Working collaboratively with Maximo, we collectively gave form to this creative endeavor.

                            Adding to the complexity and depth of the project, I also worked with breadboards and Raspberry Pi computers. These elements allowed for even more intricate interactions and possibilities within the game. It's a regrettable reality that the project's original code has been lost over time. Nevertheless, this experience left an indelible mark, nurturing my understanding of electronics, coding, game design, and the potential of linking the physical world with virtual realms. The insights I gained continue to motivate me to explore innovative projects in this realm moving forward.

                            In my sophomore year of high school, I was fortunate to participate in the Aspiring Scientists Summer Program at George Mason University (GMU) under the guidance of Professor Yotam Gingold. This program became the platform for an exciting venture that combined game development, research, and cutting-edge technology.

                            My primary objective was to delve into the relationship between age and the sense of ownership over virtual bodies. To carry out this research experiment effectively, I chose to create a simulation using the Unity game engine. With Professor Yotam Gingold as my mentor, I embarked on a journey to harness Unity's potential and craft an immersive environment for participants.

                            For the technological aspect, I incorporated LEAP motion sensors into the project. These sensors played a pivotal role in tracking the movements of the participants' hands and replicating them within the virtual world in real time. The precision of this tracking was essential to provide an authentic representation of how participants interacted with virtual objects.

                            The experimental setup was thoughtfully designed. Participants engaged with the virtual environment on a computer monitor, where objects would appear randomly, occupying their entire field of view. By positioning their hands behind the monitor, participants were immersed further, aiming to heighten their sense of presence and engagement in the virtual space.

                            To bring all these components together, I immersed myself in learning C#, a programming language crucial for Unity game development. Through coding and integrating various APIs, I ensured the seamless interaction between the Unity environment and the LEAP motion sensors.

                            The Aspiring Scientists Summer Program at GMU, led by Professor Yotam Gingold, provided a remarkable opportunity for me to explore technology, research, and experimentation. The project I undertook during this program not only underscored my commitment to learning and innovation but also highlighted the importance of mentorship and collaboration in achieving ambitious goals.

                        <p>
                            Throughout my senior year of high school, I undertook a significant personal project involving the restoration of my uncle's 1999 Honda Prelude. This venture was a collaborative effort with five of my friends and took place in my garage. The project provided me with invaluable lessons in project management, budgeting, and technical automotive skills.

                            With zero prior knowledge, I delved into understanding how vehicles mechanically functioned. As we worked on the car, I gradually progressed from a complete novice to an amateur mechanic capable of diagnosing and rectifying issues in similar Honda cars.

                            The project proved to be an exercise in resourcefulness, as we managed a tight budget while acquiring the necessary tools and parts. Despite our enthusiasm, there were challenges and failures along the way. At one point, we had to pause the project for several months due to financial constraints.

                            Ultimately, this endeavor taught me more than just technical skills. I gained insights into coordinating a team, managing limited resources, and overcoming setbacks. The restoration journey from start to finish highlighted my growth as an individual, showcasing my transformation from a beginner to a capable mechanic with a deeper appreciation for both the mechanical intricacies of vehicles and the importance of perseverance in the face of obstacles.

                            In CS1110, I crafted an engaging asteroids game using Python. This project honed my skills in working with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) while solidifying my proficiency in Python programming. Through this endeavor, I gained hands-on experience in game development and learned to create interactive and visually appealing applications.

                            Moving on to CS2110, I embarked on a different challenge by implementing a program that utilized Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize a maze game. This project delved into the realm of data structures, as well as time complexity considerations. Utilizing Java for this endeavor, I expanded my programming toolkit and developed a deeper understanding of how algorithms and data structures interact to solve complex problems.

                            Both of these class projects not only provided practical coding experience but also enriched my understanding of different programming languages, algorithms, and software development concepts. These projects stand as testament to my growth as a programmer and my ability to tackle diverse challenges within the field of computer science.
